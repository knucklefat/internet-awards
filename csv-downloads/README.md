# CSV Downloads Folder

This folder contains automatic exports of nomination data.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named with timestamps: `nominations-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-mmmZ.csv`

Example: `nominations-2026-01-24T10-25-30-123Z.csv`

## Automatic Cleanup

The export script automatically keeps only the most recent 100 CSV files to prevent disk space issues.

## Manual Access

You can also manually download CSVs by:
1. Opening the app in your browser
2. Clicking "View All Nominations & Stats"
3. Clicking "Export All to CSV"
